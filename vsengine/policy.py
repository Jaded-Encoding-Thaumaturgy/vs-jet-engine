"""
vsengine.policy implements a basic object-oriented implementation of
EnvironmentPolicies.


Here is a quick run-down in how to use it, (but be sure to read on to select
the best store-implementation for you):

    >>> import vapoursynth as vs
    >>> with Policy(GlobalStore()) as policy:
    ...     with policy.new_environment() as env:
    ...         with env.use():
    ...             vs.core.std.BlankClip().set_output()
    ...         print(env.outputs)
    {0: <vapoursynth.VideoOutputTuple ...>}


To use it, you first have to pick an EnvironmentStore implementation.
An EnvironmentStore is just a simple object implementing the methods
set_current_environment and get_current_environment.
These actually implement the state an EnvironmentPolicy is responsible
for managing.

For convenience, three EnvironmentStores have already been implemented,
tailored for different uses and concurrency needs:

- The GlobalStore is useful when you are ever only using one Environment
  at the same time.

- ThreadLocalStore is useful when you are writing multi-threaded applications,
  that can run multiple environments at once. This one behaves like vsscript.

- ContextVarStore is useful when you are using event-loops like asyncio,
  curio, and trio. When using this store, make sure to reuse the store
  between successive Policy-instances as otherwise the old store might
  leak objects. More details are written in the documentation of the
  contextvars module of the standard library.

All three implementations can be instantiated without any arguments.


The instance of the EnvironmentStore is then passed to Policy, on which
you then call register on.

You can create ManagedEnvironment-instances by calling
policy.new_environment(). These instances can then be used to switch to
the given environment, retrieve its outputs or get its core.

Be aware that ManagedEnvironment-instances must call dispose() when
you are done using them. Failing to do so will result in a warning.
ManagedEnvironment is also a context-manager which does it for you.

When reloading the application, you can call policy.unregister()
